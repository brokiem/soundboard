## Limitations

The current limitation of the Soundboard App is the inability to use keybinds when the soundboard window is not focused. This means that if you switch to another application or window, the keybinds will not work until you bring the soundboard window back into focus. We are actively working on addressing this limitation and aim to provide a seamless keybind experience in future updates.
